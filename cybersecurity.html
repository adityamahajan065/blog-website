                <h1>Cybersecurity Awareness: Protecting You and Your Digital World</h1>
                <p>Hey there! In today’s digital age, we all spend a lot of time online—whether at work, home, or on the go. But just like locking your front door keeps your home safe, taking a few simple steps online can protect your personal info and your company’s data from cyber threats.</p>

                <h2>Why care about cybersecurity?</h2>
                <p>Cyber attackers are getting smarter and trickier. They use emails, websites, and even phone calls to try to steal passwords, personal info, or sneak malware into your devices. A small mistake—like clicking a suspicious link—can lead to big trouble.</p>

                <h3>Here’s how you can help keep everyone safe:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Think before you click.</strong> If an email or message looks fishy or unexpected, don’t open links or attachments right away. When in doubt, ask your IT team.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use strong, unique passwords.</strong> Avoid easy-to-guess passwords like “123456” or “password.” Use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols, and never reuse passwords across sites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep software updated.</strong> Those annoying update pop-ups? They’re important! Updates fix security holes hackers might try to exploit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be careful with public Wi-Fi.</strong> When possible, avoid accessing sensitive info on open Wi-Fi networks. Use a VPN if your company provides one.</li>
                    <li><strong>Report anything unusual.</strong> If you see strange emails, unexpected pop-ups, or weird computer behavior, tell your IT team right away.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Remember, cybersecurity isn’t just a job for IT—it’s everyone’s responsibility. By staying alert and following these tips, you help protect yourself, your colleagues, and your company’s valuable data.</p>
                <p><em>Stay safe out there!</em></p>

                <h1>Phishing Scams Explained: How to Spot and Avoid the Most Common Cyber Attack</h1>
                <p>Imagine you get an email from what looks like your bank, your boss, or even a friend. It asks you to click a link, download an attachment, or enter your password. Sounds normal, right? But what if that email is actually a trick designed to steal your personal info? That’s exactly what a phishing scam is all about.</p>

                <h2>What is phishing?</h2>
                <p>Phishing is like fishing, but instead of fish, cybercriminals are trying to “catch” your sensitive information—like passwords, credit card numbers, or social security numbers. They send fake emails, texts, or messages that look super real, hoping you’ll take the bait.</p>

                <h2>How to spot a phishing scam:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Check the sender’s email address.</strong> Does it look weird or misspelled? Real companies usually have official domains, like @yourbank.com.</li>
                    <li><strong>Look for urgent or scary language.</strong> “Your account will be closed!” or “Immediate action required!” are classic tricks to rush you into a mistake.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hover over links before clicking.</strong> Don’t click right away—hover your mouse to see the real URL. If it looks strange, don’t click it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Watch for poor spelling and grammar.</strong> Many phishing emails have obvious typos or awkward sentences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unexpected attachments? Be careful.</strong> Don’t open attachments you weren’t expecting—they might contain malware.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How to avoid falling for phishing:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Never share passwords or personal info through email or text.</li>
                    <li>When in doubt, go directly to the company’s website by typing the address yourself.</li>
                    <li>Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.</li>
                    <li>Keep your software updated to block known threats.</li>
                    <li>Report suspicious emails to your IT department or email provider.</li>
                </ul>
