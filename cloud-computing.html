          <h1>Cloud Computing: The Future of Technology</h1>
          <p>Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and store data and programs over the internet instead of on a local computer — making it more efficient and cost-effective.</p>

          <h2>What is Cloud Computing?</h2>
          <p>Imagine you have a computer that never turns off and you can access it anytime, anywhere — from your phone, your laptop, or even someone else’s computer. Now imagine that this computer lives in a huge building full of super-powerful computers (called data centers), and you don’t have to worry about buying it, maintaining it, or even updating it. That's basically what cloud computing does.</p>

          <h3>📦 A Real-Life Analogy:</h3>
          <p>Think of it like this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>You used to store your photos on your phone.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Now you use Google Photos or iCloud — your photos are safely kept "in the cloud", and you can see them from any device.</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Cloud computing does the same thing — but for apps, files, games, videos, and even entire businesses!</p>
